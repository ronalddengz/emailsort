# emailsort
Sorts emails!
<br>
I wrote this program during my summer internship at the office of senator John Liu. The office would receive a lot of emails on Gmail from constituents, sometimes regarding specific bills. I wrote a program that *labels* and *sorts* emails that contain bills numbers by the senate bill numbers.
